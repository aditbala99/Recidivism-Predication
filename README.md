# Recidivism-Predication
# README
# Project Description
This R project focuses on building and evaluating five different predictive models, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Weka, Neural Nets, and Naive Bayesian, for a specific problem or dataset. Additionally, we explored the impact of different Attribute Selection algorithms on these models to identify the most effective feature selection approach.

# Models and Algorithms

Predictive Models:
Support Vector Machine,
Random Forest,
Weka,      
Neural Nets,  
Naive Bayesian

Attribute Selection Algorithms:
XG Boost,    
Random Forest,    
Forward Selection,
Backward Eliminatio,,
Chi Square Test


# Results
After experimenting with different Attribute Selection algorithms on the five predictive models, we found that Backward Elimination consistently yielded the best results. It achieved an accuracy of 83% across all five models, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing the model's performance.
